- Add additional layers of abstraction on order to reach flexibility

- Problem - Solution guidelines, abstract code

2. Benefits and Drawbacks

Benefits:
- large-scale reuse
- speed-up the development
- better communication

Drawbacks:
- They solve a problem in a particular way, may not be the best way
- Do not lead to a direct code reuse
- Design pattern overload
- Should be used only if understood well


3. Types of design patterns
- Creational
